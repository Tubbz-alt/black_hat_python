# Code implementations

Based on "Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters" by Justin Seitz.

These are scripts and ideas that I thought would be interesting to implement. 

This repo use to live in my private account, but decided to make it public.

Feel free to make changes and suggestions.
